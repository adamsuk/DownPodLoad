# DownPodLoader

A little rough around the edges but this tools served me well over the years.
I own a car without bluetooth and the most convenient method of listening to
music and podcasts is via a USB drive. So some years ago I cobbled this 
together to fetch my podcasts and download any missing episodes whilst naming
them in a consistent way I could navigate to them from my cars console.

### Future uses

- It can obtain and parse RSS feeds pretty darn tooting well.

In all honesty that's probably it now a bluetooth enabled car is inching closer
and closer.

### Todos

For all the hassle this lil collection has saved I'd like to do it some justice
and make it a big boi module... for ol' times sake.
